# Dataset Constructor

In this repository, we demonstrate how to utilize content-based image retrieval methods to construct training datasets. To this end, we prepared a demonstration notebook that examplifies through the process of enriching a subset of BEN with underrepresented labels such as coniferous forest. The `dataset_demo.ipynb` guides through the process in different sections and explains the necessary steps.
